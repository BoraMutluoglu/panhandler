Adding a New Skillet Repository
===============================

Panhandler is preloaded with a wide set of skillets yet you may still have to manually add skillet repos.

The repo window will show a description of the repo along with the last few content changes.

Choose `Update to Latest` to check for and pull template updates.

.. Note::
    `Already up to date` will show that no changes were made to the source skillet and no udpates required.
